# C-Ray-Tracer
A simple ray tracer written in C++. Outputs a PNG of the scene. Recursive reflections and shadows.

Check the include PNG files for the output of the scenes.

NOTE: With the exception of ray_intersect.cpp and most of main.cpp, the remainder of the code was provided by the TA (including the code to output to a PNG).
